# Weclome to my Git Hub Profile!
## **Background:**
I went to the University of Colorado Boulder for my Bachelors in Information Management and currently my Masters in Business Analytics (focus in Security). As seen pinned to my profile are a couple different projects I've worked on throughout the years.

### SQL Tutoring questions:
Going on 4 semesters, I have been a Teaching Assistant for a course focusing on SQL. This repository includes questions I have written for students that are meant to help students practice different concepts.

> **Note:** All code was written in GCP Bigquery and I use their [public datasets](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=solution-type:dataset) for the practice questions.

### Predicting Recent College Graudate Salaries:
Using data provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/e1cfbb38c0fe2129a6e744aff1ebd180d4d4c8097a17f9f2860027c0c0793c36?select=batch2_jobID_00B80TR.csv), my team and I created and evaluated different machine learning models to predict what a salary should be given factors like education level, years of experience, college major, etc. The different models used in our analysis include KNN Regression, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

### Humbleify Penetration Testing:
While working on my Bachelors, I took a class called Information Security Management. For a project in this classwe were asked to perfom a Penetration Test on the [Humbleify server](https://github.com/security-assignments/pentest-humbleify). I have this class and project to thank for spurring my interest in the Security focus with in the M.S. Business Analytics program.
